Context and scope","keywords":"","body":"System Scope and Context\n\nWhat are the goals of the system?\n\n\nThe main idea of this project is to create a decentralised chat, in other words, we are creating an application capable of conecting to SOLID and allow their users to communicate between them. In order to be a decentralised chat we use SOLID’s pods. The whole idea is using our application\nas a point where you can access your data stored in SOLID and manage it in order to send messages and other data to other users. Our application is completely transparent to the user and SOLID as we don’t store any user informatio, we just allow them to send it. Also our applicatio is completely compatible with the\nexisting SOLID chat avaible making our application also capable of interact with the orginal chat available on the platform.\n\n\nUse case\n\n\n\n\nThe communication is done through the user’s pods. Everytime a user sends a mesage it is communicated to his/her pod and then that change is notifiyed to the other user De-chat, that is when the read of the pod is done. As we can see all the data is stored safely on the pods and can be\ndeleared at any time by the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Context\n\n\nThis section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders in our system, offering a graphic view of the business and technical context of it and specifying its external interfaces.\n\n\nSimple diagram representing the business context:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

We also use SOLID authentication\nservices and some other libraries in order manage the pods for reading and writing the data there. Algular framework is used for simplicity as it is a one page application.\n\n\n"},"04_solution_strategy.html":{"url":"04_solution_strategy.html","title":"4. Solution Strategy","keywords":"","body":"\nSolution Strategy\n\n\n\n\nDuring our allotted four months of development time we plan to build our decentralized chat application through an agile style of development, allowing for an iterative methodology with time to consider testing and improvements in functionality, aesthetics, and security. Through weekly meetings in designated laboratory sessions as well as additional meetings called as the team sees fit, we will be able to meet and collaborate in person as well as over the internet through GitHub and WhatsApp.\n\n\nAs the application’s development progresses and a functional prototype is developed, we will draw upon each individual team member’s personal strengths (security, back end logic, UI design, etc) to push the project into a release stage.\n\n\nIn order to ensure in a measurable manner that our application is functioning correctly, we will write and deploy tests to evaluate certain features. These tests will be completed using the Cucumber tool for software testing. The team has decided to forego end-to-end testing in favor of unit testing for the application in order to ensure a smooth and accessible testing methodology and ensure code coverage is at an appropriate percentage by the deliverable date.\n\n\n\n\n"},"05_building_block_view.html":{"url":"05_building_block_view.html","title":"5.

It can be located anywhere, not on a single platform.\n\n\nClient: the de_chat program running on the user’s browser. Its responsability is to give the functionality, not to store the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Experience\n\nOne of the keypoint of the application. The user should not notice any difference from using other chats, like Facebook or WhatsApp.\nThere two main reasons for this:\n* Facilitate the migration from other chat systems easy for any kind of user.\n* Prove that it is posible to have the very same services that we currently enjoy using the SOLID system\n\n\n\nArchitecture and design patterns\n\nUp until know, the de_chat is an Angular-based system, therefore following the Model View Controller architectural pattern.\nHowever, all our application would not store any of the user’s data. It will access it via SOLID pods.\n\n\n\nPersistency\n\nThe persistency has been achieved using the RTC and turtle (.ttl) files. Thus, making use of the standard already in place in SOLID, and allowing the interaction of DE_CHAT and the SOLID chat system.\n\n\n\nSession handling\n\nThe session is managed using the SOLID session itself, as it is that platform the one in charge of storing the user’s data.\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\nTwo chats would not communicate directly. I will occur via SOLID pods, which are the ones storing the messages. The application provides a realtime notification daemon to allow users to talk fluently.\n\n\n\nTesting\n\nTwo types of testing are currently in place:\n\n\n\n\nUnit testing: in charge of testing the low level features of the system.\n\n\nEnd to end: in charge of testing the general behavior of the system by mocking a real user.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding\n\nThe building of the project, considering that it is an Angular application, is done via the Node.js package manages, npm.\nIt is expected to be built using the docker platform, in order to avoid dependencies and enviorment issues.\n\n\n\n"},"09_design_decisions.html":{"url":"09_design_decisions.html","title":"9. Architecture Decisions","keywords":"","body":"\nArchitecture and Design Decisions\n\n\n\n\nAs the project progresses, it is possible that the tools we initially decide to use will change in favor of methods that interface in an easier way. The following table lists the tools we are currently using as well as our rationale for electing them.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nSolid\nSolid is the framework for our ability to create a decentralized form of data transfer between users. It is also a tool we are tasked with learning for the assignment.\n\n\nAngular 6\nAngular 6 is the framework for the front-end web development portion of our application. Its user accessibility and command line interface are attractive features for our collaborative and iterative development style.\n\n\nTypeScript\nTypeScript will act as the primary development language for the project. The language interfaces well with the other tools the team has elected to use, ensuring a simplified and efficient development process.\n\n\nHTML/CSS\nWith tools provided by Angular 6, HTML and CSS will allow for the development of the design and functionality of the web-application.\n\n\nArc42\nArc42 will act as the documentation framework, allowing for ease and organization in the process of continually updating the documentation for the project as it progresses.\n\n\nTurtle\nTurtle is a syntax format for expressing data in the RDF data model. This specific syntax allows us to efficiently represent data that will be sent to and from users over the web.\n\n\nCucumber\nCucumber will serve as our tool for automatically testing our software. Its use is advised by our professors and it serves as a simple and concise framework for creating tests to measurably examine our software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax for the storage\n\n\n\nStoring the conversations is one of the biggest hurdles for this project. At first we were pointing at a JSON file stored in a POD and reading/writing the whole file each acces.\nThis not only proved hard and resource-intensive but, after more deliberation, we realised it broke the \"data reusability\" SOLID principle.\nThis prompted us to look for a different way and we ended up with turtle and a structure equivalent to that used by the native data browser.\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\n\n\nWe mainly use the basic RDF syntax, ical for \"LongChat\", meeting for the participants section and flow to manage the message flow. We will also need to use acl for editing permissions on the POD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"10_quality_scenarios.html":{"url":"10_quality_scenarios.html","title":"10.

Risks and Technical Debt","keywords":"","body":"Risks and Technical Debts\n\nIn this project we are dealing with a bunch of different technologies working alltogther causing some risk and problems:\n\n\n\n\nSOLID: Solid is a platform in continous change and evolving everyday, this makes developing our application\nquite difficult, we have to manage many concepts and changes quite fast. Also the lack of documentation of some moodules add some programming risks and algo makes the task more difficult.\n\n\nTypeScript: A web language in which we are not native, most of our group is Java native,we had to\nuse JavaScript (compatible with TypeScript) in order to optimize our compatibility with most of the code available in the SOLID platform and other modules.\nUsing TypeScript also adds the problem that most of the examples that we can try to use are not writen in TS and oly on JavaScript.\n\n\nRDF: Usede for modeling our data, this is a techlogy that we are not familiar with.\n\n\nTurtle: A container for RDF data, this allows to focus only on Turtle but add the risk of not knowing \"what is under the hood\".\n\n\nAngular: Web framework, this allows a faster development but also adds the complexity of managing the framework.\n\n\n\n\nAs we can conclude this project requires many technologies working alltogether to\ncreate this decentralised chat.\n"},"12_glossary.html":{"url":"12_glossary.html","title":"12.
