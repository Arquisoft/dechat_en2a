Also they will need a detailed documentation of what this project does and does not do\n\n\nEnd users\nThe people who will end up using this functionalities on their daily basis. The project should be built so that everyone can have a basic knowledge of this project and how it does work\nThey will look for an intuitive and easy to use application that does not focus on bombarding the users with new and complex information\n\n\nGoverment\nAll organization that uses user’s data without their consent.\nNew laws should be passed so that user’s PODs will not be eligible to be seized by a organization without the explicit consent of the owner of the POD.

This concept focuses on the idea of nobody obtaining or taking advantage of the information that they manage, the users must take control of who is allowed to use and see their data and where it is stored.\n\n\nAs software engineers we must contribute to create a platform that fulfils this axiom. The communication between users is done via pods, a sort of personal folder where the users can store the data they want, then they can select using the SOLID platform who can access that data and then the platform allows the other users access that data, we can consider that the platform acts as a keyring and each user lends their own keys, these keys grant access to the data to certain user/s.\n\n\nOur main goal is to allow this communication process posible. In order to do so, we must use some sort of secure communication system and adapt it to the point it can be usable. We also must take into account other systems that may interact with the platform such as other storage systems such as image hosting services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see our application validates the permissions of the receiver to show the data to the receiver and after that check, if passed then the data is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThis section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders in our system, offering a graphic view of the business and technical context of it and specifying its external interfaces.\n\n\nBusiness Context\n\n\n\nSimple diagram representing the business context:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.
