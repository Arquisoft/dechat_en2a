In order to be a decentralised chat we use SOLID’s pods. The whole idea is using our application\nas a point where you can access your data stored in SOLID and manage it in order to send messages and other data to other users. Our application is completely transparent to the user and SOLID as we don’t store any user informatio, we just allow them to send it. Also our applicatio is completely compatible with the\nexisting SOLID chat avaible making our application also capable of interact with the orginal chat available on the platform.\n\n\nUse case\n\n\n\n\nThe communication is done through the user’s pods. Everytime a user sends a mesage it is communicated to his/her pod and then that change is notifiyed to the other user De-chat, that is when the read of the pod is done. As we can see all the data is stored safely on the pods and can be\ndeleared at any time by the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Context\n\n\nThis section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders in our system, offering a graphic view of the business and technical context of it and specifying its external interfaces.\n\n\nSimple diagram representing the business context:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

We also use SOLID authentication\nservices and some other libraries in order manage the pods for reading and writing the data there. Algular framework is used for simplicity as it is a one page application.\n\n\n"},"04_solution_strategy.html":{"url":"04_solution_strategy.html","title":"Solution Strategy","keywords":"","body":"\nSolution Strategy\n\n\n\n\nDuring our allotted four months of development time we plan to build our decentralized chat application through an agile style of development, allowing for an iterative methodology with time to consider testing and improvements in functionality, aesthetics, and security. Through weekly meetings in designated laboratory sessions as well as additional meetings called as the team sees fit, we will be able to meet and collaborate in person as well as over the internet through GitHub and WhatsApp. As the application’s development progresses and a functional prototype is developed, we will draw upon each individual team member’s personal strengths (security, back end logic, UI design, etc) to push the project into a release stage.\n\n\n\n\n"},"05_building_block_view.html":{"url":"05_building_block_view.html","title":"Building Block View","keywords":"","body":"\nBuilding Block View\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
