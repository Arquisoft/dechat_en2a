Context and scope","keywords":"","body":"\nSystem Scope and Context\n\n\n\n\nThe main idea of this project is to create a decentralised chat, in other words, creating a plamtform independent of someone or something that stores the data of the users. This concept focuses on the idea of nobody obtaining or taking advantage of the information that they manage, the users must take control of who is allowed to use and see their data and where it is stored.\n\n\nAs software engineers we must contribute to create a platform that fulfils this axiom. The communication between users is done via pods, a sort of personal folder where the users can store the data they want, then they can select using the SOLID platform who can access that data and then the platform allows the other users access that data, we can consider that the platform acts as a keyring and each user lends their own keys, these keys grant access to the data to certain user/s.\n\n\nOur main goal is to allow this communication process posible. In order to do so, we must use some sort of secure communication system and adapt it to the point it can be usable. We also must take into account other systems that may interact with the platform such as other storage systems such as image hosting services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see our application validates the permissions of the receiver to show the data to the receiver and after that check, if passed then the data is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThis section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders in our system, offering a graphic view of the business and technical context of it and specifying its external interfaces.\n\n\nBusiness Context\n\n\n\nSimple diagram representing the business context:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Its responsability is to give the functionality, not to store the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Experience\n\nOne of the keypoint of the application. The user should not notice any difference from using other chats, like Facebook or WhatsApp.\nThere two main reasons for this:\n* Facilitate the migration from other chat systems easy for any kind of user.\n* Prove that it is posible to have the very same services that we currently enjoy using the SOLID system\n\n\n===Architecture and design patterns\nUp until know, the de_chat is an Angular-based system, therefore following the Model View Controller architectural pattern.\nHowever, all our application would not store any of the user’s data.

Architecture Decisions","keywords":"","body":"\nArchitecture and Design Decisions\n\n\n\n\nAs the project progresses, it is possible that the tools we initially decide to use will change in favor of methods that interface in an easier way. The following table lists the tools we are currently using as well as our rationale for electing them.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nSolid\nSolid is the framework for our ability to create a decentralized form of data transfer between users. It is also a tool we are tasked with learning for the assignment.\n\n\nAngular 6\nAngular 6 is the framework for the front-end web development portion of our application. Its user accessibility and command line interface are attractive features for our collaborative and iterative development style.\n\n\nTypeScript\nTypeScript will act as the primary development language for the project. The language interfaces well with the other tools the team has elected to use, ensuring a simplified and efficient development process.\n\n\nHTML/CSS\nWith tools provided by Angular 6, HTML and CSS will allow for the development of the design and functionality of the web-application.\n\n\nArc42\nArc42 will act as the documentation framework, allowing for ease and organization in the process of continually updating the documentation for the project as it progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax for the storage\n\n\n\nStoring the conversations is one of the biggest hurdles for this project. At first we were pointing at a JSON file stored in a POD and reading/writing the whole file each acces.\nThis not only proved hard and resource-intensive but, after more deliberation, we realised it broke the \"data reusability\" SOLID principle.\nThis prompted us to look for a different way and we ended up with turtle and a structure equivalent to that used by the native data browser.\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\n\n\nWe mainly use the basic RDF syntax, ical for \"LongChat\", meeting for the participants section and flow to manage the message flow. We will also need to use acl for editing permissions on the POD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"10_quality_scenarios.html":{"url":"10_quality_scenarios.html","title":"10.

Therefore, the user is always in control of its own data.\nSolid’s web page\n\n\nPod\nA repository on which the user’s data is stored. I can be located where the user decides, even in her/his own device.\nGetting your own pod\n\n\nJavaScript\nInterpreted programming language designed to provide dynamic behaviour to web pages which otherwise would be static documents.\nMozilla JavaScript reference\n\n\nAngular\nJavaScript framework to develop web pages offering the functionality of desktop programs. An example of this could be Google Docs.\nAngular’s web page\n\n\nTravis\nTravis is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.\nTravis’s web page\n\n\nCucumber\nCucumber is a software tool used for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development style (BDD).\nCucumber’s web page\n\n\nDocker\nA Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.\nDocker’s web page\n\n\nGherkin\nGherkin is the language that Cucumber uses to define test cases. It is designed to be non-technical and human readable, and collectively describes use cases relating to a software system.\nGherkin reference\n\n\nProtractor\nProtractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\nProtractor’s web page\n\n\nStore (rdflib)\nA place where all the fetched documents are dumped, it takes car of the graph as it is in its local form and can be queried and edited before sending an update to the remote server using the local data.\n\n\n\nFetch (rdflib)\nThe fetcher loads a document given its uri and dumps it in the store to be used, edited and then remotely updated\n\n\n\nURI\nUniform Resource Identifier is a string (usually of the URL form) that locates a resource (be it a container, a ttl file or any other kind of file) inside a data store.\n\n\n\nTurtle\nOne of the serialization formats supported by RDF. It is very human-friendly and readable. Other supported formats are: N-Triples, N-Quads, JSON-LD, N3, RDF/XML or RDF/JSON.\n\n\n\nStandard\n\n\nWikipedia Page\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular Router\nThe router is in charge of the routes in the app, Angular apps are SPA (Single Page Application) and therefore simulate navigation by changing the url when there is only one index.html file.\nRouter documentation\n\n\nPromise\nAn async function can return the 'Promise' that in the future there will be a 'Whatever' in its place but it has not been obtained yet. That way your program can continue passing that Promise around until you actually need the value which is when you wait for the Promise to resolve if it hasn’t yet.\nPromises basics\n\n\n\n\n"},"13_project_structure.html":{"url":"13_project_structure.html","title":"13.
