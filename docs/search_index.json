This concept focuses on the idea of nobody obtaining or taking advantage of the information that they manage, the users must take control of who is allowed to use and see their data and where it is stored.\n\n\nAs software engineers we must contribute to create a platform that fulfils this axiom. The communication between users is done via pods, a sort of personal folder where the users can store the data they want, then they can select using the SOLID platform who can access that data and then the platform allows the other users access that data, we can consider that the platform acts as a keyring and each user lends their own keys, these keys grant access to the data to certain user/s.\n\n\nOur main goal is to allow this communication process posible. In order to do so, we must use some sort of secure communication system and adapt it to the point it can be usable. We also must take into account other systems that may interact with the platform such as other storage systems such as image hosting services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see our application validates the permissions of the receiver to show the data to the receiver and after that check, if passed then the data is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThis section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders in our system, offering a graphic view of the business and technical context of it and specifying its external interfaces.\n\n\nBusiness Context\n\n\n\nSimple diagram representing the business context:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The user should not notice any difference from using other chats, like Facebook or WhatsApp.\nThere two main reasons for this:\n* Facilitate the migration from other chat systems easy for any kind of user.\n* Prove that it is posible to have the very same services that we currently enjoy using the SOLID system\n\n\n\nArchitecture and design patterns\n\nUp until know, the de_chat is an Angular-based system, therefore following the Model View Controller architectural pattern.\nHowever, all our application would not store any of the user’s data. It will access it via SOLID pods.\n\n\n\nPersistency\n\nThe persistency has been achieved using the RTC and turtle (.ttl) files. Thus, making use of the standard already in place in SOLID, and allowing the interaction of DE_CHAT and the SOLID chat system.\n\n\n\nSession handling\n\nThe session is managed using the SOLID session itself, as it is that platform the one in charge of storing the user’s data.\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\nTwo chats would not communicate directly. I will occur via SOLID pods, which are the ones storing the messages. The application provides a realtime notification daemon to allow users to talk fluently.\n\n\n\nTesting\n\nTwo types of testing are currently in place:\n\n\n\n\nUnit testing: in charge of testing the low level features of the system.\n\n\nEnd to end: in charge of testing the general behavior of the system by mocking a real user.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding\n\nThe building of the project, considering that it is an Angular application, is done via the Node.js package manages, npm.\nIt is expected to be built using the docker platform, in order to avoid dependencies and enviorment issues.\n\n\n\n"},"09_design_decisions.html":{"url":"09_design_decisions.html","title":"Architecture Decisions","keywords":"","body":"\nArchitecture and Design Decisions\n\n\n\n\nAs the project progresses, it is possible that the tools we initially decide to use will change in favor of methods that interface in an easier way. The following table lists the tools we are currently using as well as our rationale for electing them.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTool\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nSolid\nSolid is the framework for our ability to create a decentralized form of data transfer between users. It is also a tool we are tasked with learning for the assignment.\n\n\nAngular 6\nAngular 6 is the framework for the front-end web development portion of our application. Its user accessibility and command line interface are attractive features for our collaborative and iterative development style.\n\n\nTypeScript\nTypeScript will act as the primary development language for the project. The language interfaces well with the other tools the team has elected to use, ensuring a simplified and efficient development process.\n\n\nHTML/CSS\nWith tools provided by Angular 6, HTML and CSS will allow for the development of the design and functionality of the web-application.\n\n\nArc42\nArc42 will act as the documentation framework, allowing for ease and organization in the process of continually updating the documentation for the project as it progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax for the storage\n\n\n\nStoring the conversations is one of the biggest hurdles for this project. At first we were pointing at a JSON file stored in a POD and reading/writing the whole file each acces.\nThis not only proved hard and resource-intensive but, after more deliberation, we realised it broke the \"data reusability\" SOLID principle.\nThis prompted us to look for a different way and we ended up with turtle and a structure equivalent to that used by the native data browser.\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\n\n\nWe mainly use the basic RDF syntax, ical for \"LongChat\", meeting for the participants section and flow to manage the message flow. We will also need to use acl for editing permissions on the POD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"10_quality_scenarios.html":{"url":"10_quality_scenarios.html","title":"Quality Requirements","keywords":"","body":"\nQuality Requirements\n\n\nQuality Requirements Tree\n\n\n\nBelow is a tree representing the quality requirements and their specifications for the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality Type\nSource of Stimulus\nStimulus\nArtifact\nEnvironment\nResponse\nResponse Measure\n\n\n\n\nAvailability\nInternet Connection\nInternet connection failure\nCommunication channel\nNormal environment\nSave data state\nData is recovered and available upon internet reconnection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"11_technical_risks.html":{"url":"11_technical_risks.html","title":"Risks and Technical Debt","keywords":"","body":"\nRisks and Technical Debts\n\n\nWhen we are talking about technical concepts, usually, we are defining a mature system or technology.\nThis is not the case of our decentralised chat, we are dealing with some experimental our unfinished projects:\n\n\n*SOLID: Solid is a platform in continous change and evolving everyday, this makes developing our application\nquite difficult, we have to manage many concepts and changes quite fast.\n\n\n*JavaScript: A web language in which we are not native, most of our group is Java native,we had to\nuse JavaScript in order to optimize our compatibility with most of the code available in the SOLID platform.\n\n\n*Rdf: Another technology we did not know until we arrived at this project.\n\n\n*Turtle: A container for RDF data, this allows to focus only on turtle leaving some concepts of rdf forgotten.\n\n\n*Angular: Web framework written in TypeSrpit another language that we have not used before this project.\n\n\nAs we can conclude this project requires many technologies working alltogether to\ncreate this chat.\n\n\n"},"12_glossary.html":{"url":"12_glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"\nGlossary\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nSmall index of terms commonly seen in the project.
