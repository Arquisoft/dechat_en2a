This concept focuses on the idea of nobody obtaining or taking advantage of the information that they manage, the users must take control of who is allowed to use and see their data and where it is stored.\n\n\nAs software engineers we must contribute to create a platform that fulfils this axiom. The communication between users is done via pods, a sort of personal folder where the users can store the data they want, then they can select using the SOLID platform who can access that data and then the platform allows the other users access that data, we can consider that the platform acts as a keyring and each user lends their own keys, these keys grant access to the data to certain user/s.\n\n\nOur main goal is to allow this communication process posible. In order to do so, we must use some sort of secure communication system and adapt it to the point it can be usable. We also must take into account other systems that may interact with the platform such as other storage systems such as image hosting services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see our application validates the permissions of the receiver to show the data to the receiver and after that check, if passed then the data is displayed.\n\n\n\n\nThis section shows a representation of the communication partners and stakeholders in our system, offering a graphic view of the business and technical context of it and specifying its external interfaces.\n\n\nBusiness Context\n\nThis is our business context:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The decentralization aspect of the application is the central motivation for its completion with the use and learning of Solid at the core of the development.\n\n\nTechnology Decisions\nSolid: Solid will act as the framework for supporting the decentralization of the data flow of the application. It will provide the necessary tools to enable users to control the release and destination of their data without the use of a centralized entity.\n\n\nAngular 7: Angular 7 will act as the framework for the web-application. It will allow for an organized and streamlined development process as the team constructs the front-end of the client and facilitates communication with the back-end logic of the system.\n\n\nTypeScript: TypeScript will act as the primary development language for the project. The language interfaces well with the other tools the team has elected to use, ensuring a simplified and efficient development process.\n\n\nHTML and CSS: With tools provided by Angular 7, HTML and CSS will allow for the development of the design and functionality of the web-application.\n\n\nArc42: Arc42 will act as the documentation framework, allowing for ease and organization in the process of continually updating the documentation for the project as it progresses.\n\n\nArchitectural Pattern\nThe team will follow a peer-to-peer architectural pattern. This will be advantageous for the product as it supports a decentralized system and will allow for relative ease in scalability (i.e. scaling from one-on-one chat to group messaging). A disadvantage of this system is ensuring data security for users, however with the use of Solid, a preexisting security system will be in place to protect and control the flow of user data.\n\n\nDevelopment Process\nThe team is yet to concretely determine a development process to be implemented for the creation of the product, however it is likely we will use a waterfall development model, allowing us to focus specifically on one phase of development at a time and ensuring organization and structure within the development process.\n\n\nAs more of the development and design decisions for the application become apparent within the team, this section will continue to update and grow more elaborative.\n\n\n\n\n"},"05_building_block_view.html":{"url":"05_building_block_view.html","title":"Building Block View","keywords":"","body":"\nBuilding Block View\n\n\n\n\nContent\nThe building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,\ninterfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,\ndatas structures, …​) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, …​)\n\n\nThis view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.\nIn analogy to a house this is the floor plan.\n\n\nMotivation\nMaintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through\nabstraction.\n\n\nThis allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.\n\n\nForm\nThe building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes\n(see figure below) and their descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1 is the white box description of the overall system together with black\nbox descriptions of all contained building blocks.\n\n\nLevel 2 zooms into some building blocks of level 1.\nThus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.\n\n\nLevel 3 zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nWhitebox Overall System\n\n\n\nHere you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template.
