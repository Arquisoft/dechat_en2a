I am *Ángel García*, third year student at the School of Computer Engineering of Oviedo. Proud member of the Free Software Foundation as an associate student, I am one of those who will say __GNU/Linux__. The testing infraestructure, frameworks and this manual has beeen parts of my contribution to DE_CHAT. Regarding engineering capabilities, I am also the one who though that a loop of 168 repetitions with SQL queries to a single database was a good idea.

My hobbies include but are not limited to reading, long bike rides (like weeks long), climbing, mountaineering, playing video games and travelling (who doesn't like travelling).

My name is *Thomas Perry* and I am a second year student from the United States studying for a semester at the University of Oviedo Software Engineering campus.
