== What is DE_CHAT?

DE_CHAT stands for Decentralized Chat. It is simply what its name indicates: a chat application which not centralized arround a single provider, but distributed arround its users.

Its development began as the practical assigment for the https://arquisoft.github.io[Software Architecture] course from the degree on Software Engineering of the University of Oviedo. 

No longer will you be preocupied about what facebook or whatsapp do with your messages. They are yours, controlled by you, and you are the only responsible for them. 

All of this is based on the SOLID project, a software platform and specification by https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card#i[Sir Tim Berners Lee] and the MIT, which is further discussed in the present document.
