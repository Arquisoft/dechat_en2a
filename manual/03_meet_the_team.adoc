I am *Ángel García*, third year student at the School of Computer Engineering of Oviedo. Proud member of the Free Software Foundation as an associate student, I am one of those who will say __GNU/Linux__. The testing infraestructure, frameworks and this manual has beeen parts of my contribution to DE_CHAT. Regarding engineering capabilities, I am also the one who though that a loop of 168 repetitions with SQL queries to a single database was a good idea.

My name is *Thomas Perry* and I am a second year student from the United States studying for a semester at the University of Oviedo Software Engineering campus. While in the States, I attend Colorado School of Mines and study Computer Science and Analytical Statistics with a focus on Data Science. On this project, I focused mainly on front-end development in order to ensure a smooth user experience while using the application. When not in front of the computer, I enjoy camping, cooking, and shooting landscape photography worldwide, but especially in my home state of Washington.
