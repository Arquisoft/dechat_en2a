As the project progresses, it is possible that the tools we initially decide to use will change in favor of methods that interface in an easier way. The following table lists the tools we are currently using as well as our rationale for electing them.

|Tool|Rationale
| Solid | Solid is the framework for our ability to create a decentralized form of data transfer between users. It is also a tool we are tasked with learning for the assignment. 
| Angular 6 | Angular 6 is the framework for the front-end web development portion of our application. Its user accessibility and command line interface are attractive features for our collaborative and iterative development style.
| TypeScript | TypeScript will act as the primary development language for the project. The language interfaces well with the other tools the team has elected to use, ensuring a simplified and efficient development process.
| HTML/CSS | With tools provided by Angular 6, HTML and CSS will allow for the development of the design and functionality of the web-application.
| Arc42 | Arc42 will act as the documentation framework, allowing for ease and organization in the process of continually updating the documentation for the project as it progresses.
